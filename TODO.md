# TestIntelligence Refactoring Progress

**Started:** September 7, 2025  
**Based on:** refactor-analysis-20250907-122422.md  

## Current Status: Phase 2 Complete! âœ… - Ready for Phase 3

### ðŸ”´ Phase 1: Critical Fixes (High Priority) âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Estimated Effort:** 8 hours | **Risk Level:** Low

- [x] **Fix blocking async operation** - `EFCorePatternDetector.cs:198` (2 hours)
- [x] **Add proper resource disposal** - `LazyWorkspaceBuilder.cs:146-156` (4 hours) 
- [x] **Remove debug code** - `MethodCallGraph.cs:118-120` (1 hour)
- [x] **Fix inefficient LINQ** - `TraceExecutionCommandHandler.cs:81-82` (2 hours)
- [x] **Run tests after Phase 1 fixes** - All 162 DataTracker tests pass!

### ðŸŸ¡ Phase 2: Architecture Improvements (Weeks 2-3) âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Estimated Effort:** 24 hours | **Risk Level:** Medium

- [x] **Split fat interface** - `ITestCoverageAnalyzer` (8 hours) âœ…
- [x] **Extract assembly path resolution service** (12 hours) âœ…
- [x] **Standardize DI lifetimes** (4 hours) âœ…
- [x] **Create shared exception handling utilities** (4 hours) âœ…

### ðŸŸ  Phase 3: Large Refactoring (Weeks 4-6)
**Estimated Effort:** 60 hours | **Risk Level:** High

- [ ] **Break down AnalysisService** into focused services (16 hours)
- [ ] **Refactor TestSelectionEngine** responsibilities (16 hours)
- [ ] **Split RoslynAnalyzer** complexity (20 hours)
- [ ] **Implement modern C# patterns** (records, collection expressions) (8 hours)

### ðŸŸ¢ Phase 4: Quality Improvements (Week 7)
**Estimated Effort:** 16 hours | **Risk Level:** Low

- [ ] **Replace magic numbers with constants** (8 hours)
- [ ] **Standardize string handling patterns** (4 hours)
- [ ] **Add comprehensive architecture tests** (4 hours)
- [ ] **Update to latest C# patterns** (included in Phase 3)

## Progress Log

### 2025-09-07 - Phase 1
- âœ… Created TODO.md to track refactoring progress
- âœ… **Phase 1 Critical Fixes Completed:**
  - âœ… Fixed blocking async operation in `EFCorePatternDetector.cs:198`
  - âœ… Improved resource disposal in `LazyWorkspaceBuilder.cs:146-156` using `using` declarations
  - âœ… Removed debug code from `MethodCallGraph.cs` and `CallGraphBuilderV2.cs`
  - âœ… Optimized LINQ usage in `TraceExecutionCommandHandler.cs:81-82` using `ToLookup`
  - âœ… Verified all fixes with successful test run (162 DataTracker tests passed)
- ðŸŽ‰ **Phase 1 Complete! All critical issues resolved with 0 test failures.**

### 2025-09-07 - Phase 2
- âœ… **Phase 2 Architecture Improvements Completed:**
  - âœ… **Split fat interface ITestCoverageAnalyzer** - Created focused interfaces:
    - `ITestCoverageQuery` - For querying which tests exercise specific methods
    - `ITestCoverageMapBuilder` - For building comprehensive coverage maps
    - `ITestCoverageStatistics` - For calculating coverage statistics
    - `ITestCoverageCacheManager` - For managing caches
  - âœ… **Extracted assembly path resolution service** - Created `IAssemblyPathResolver` and `AssemblyPathResolver`
    - Centralized assembly finding logic from multiple classes
    - Supports solution parsing, project analysis, and assembly discovery
    - Updated `TestCoverageAnalyzer`, `TestExecutionTracer`, `AnalysisService`, and `TestSelectionEngine`
  - âœ… **Standardized DI lifetimes** - Applied consistent patterns:
    - Singleton for configuration and pure utilities
    - Scoped for services with caching during operations
    - Transient for lightweight command handlers and utilities
  - âœ… **Created shared exception handling utilities** - Added `ExceptionHelper` class with:
    - Standardized parameter validation methods
    - Safe execution wrappers
    - Context-aware exception creation
    - Consistent logging patterns
- ðŸŽ‰ **Phase 2 Complete! Architecture significantly improved with better separation of concerns.**

## Existing TODOs

- [x] Clean up and refactor RoslynAnalyzerV2, it's no longer the V2 now it's the only one! Fix the name, remove the factory selector thing, etc.
- [x] 9-1-25-plan.md
- [x] additional functionality for the 9-1-25-plan where you give it a test and a specific code change (git diff?) and it tells you if the test sufficently cover the changes.
- [x] Implement persistent storage for caching for large solutions, to reduce startup and run times after first pass. and some kind of diff to update caching process.
- [ ] Increase Test Coverage to at least 90%
- [ ] Setup CI/CD on Github side. Leave out E2E tests, they take too long.
- [ ] Add this library to it's own CI/CD to verify tests that are impacted by the change are run as part of the CI
- [ ] Small Webserver to display data from runs, run history over time, etc. 
- [x] ability to filter or target specific projects using configuration file. (might not care about mapping ORM project each time, etc)

## Test Strategy
- Run full test suite after each phase
- Maintain 85%+ code coverage
- Add regression tests for major refactored components

## Success Metrics
- **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Reduce from 8.5 to 6.0
- **Class Size:** No classes > 500 lines
- **Method Size:** No methods > 50 lines
- **Interface Segregation:** Average 3 methods per interface
