# Test Intelligence Library - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The Test Intelligence Library is a .NET library designed to analyze large enterprise monorepos and provide AI agents with deep insights into test structure, dependencies, and impact analysis. This library addresses the pain points of slow test feedback cycles and inefficient test execution in large codebases by enabling intelligent test selection and impact prediction.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- Large .NET monorepos with thousands of NUnit tests take too long to execute
- AI agents making code changes must run entire test suites to validate changes
- Test failures are difficult to predict before code changes are made
- Complex test data setup and dependencies are poorly understood
- Limited visibility into which tests actually validate specific code paths

**Pain Points:**
- Full test suite execution takes 20+ minutes, slowing development cycles
- Flaky tests mask real failures
- Test data conflicts cause intermittent failures
- Difficulty determining minimal test set for validating changes
- AI agents cannot efficiently validate their changes without running everything

## Solution Overview

A comprehensive test analysis library that provides:

1. **Smart Test Categorization** - Automatically classify tests by type, speed, and dependencies
2. **Test Data Dependency Tracking** - Map test data requirements and conflicts
3. **Cross-Layer Impact Analysis** - Predict which tests are affected by code changes
4. **Intelligent Test Selection** - Run minimal test sets for maximum confidence

## Core Features

### 1. Smart Test Categorizer

**Functionality:**
- Scan NUnit test assemblies and classify tests automatically
- Identify test types: Unit, Integration, Database, API, UI (Selenium)
- Measure execution time and resource requirements
- Detect test isolation issues

**API Example:**
```csharp
var categorizer = new TestCategorizer(solutionPath);
var categories = await categorizer.AnalyzeAsync();

// Get all fast unit tests
var unitTests = categories.Where(t => t.Category == TestCategory.Unit && t.ExecutionTime < TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
```

**Output Artifacts:**
- `test-categories.json` - Classification of all tests
- `test-timing.json` - Historical execution times
- `test-flakiness-report.json` - Tests with inconsistent results

### 2. Test Data Dependency Tracker

**Functionality:**
- Analyze test setup methods ([SetUp], [OneTimeSetUp])
- Track database seeding patterns
- Identify shared test data and potential conflicts
- Map Entity Framework test data patterns

**Key Capabilities:**
- Detect tests that cannot run in parallel due to shared data
- Identify tests that require specific database states
- Track mock object dependencies
- Analyze test fixture patterns

**API Example:**
```csharp
var dependencyTracker = new TestDataDependencyTracker();
var conflicts = await dependencyTracker.FindDataConflictsAsync(testAssembly);

// Check if tests can run together
var canRunTogether = dependencyTracker.CanRunInParallel(testA, testB);
```

### 3. Cross-Layer Impact Analysis

**Functionality:**
- Static analysis of code-to-test relationships
- Dynamic analysis during test execution
- Change impact prediction
- Test coverage mapping to source code

**Core Analysis:**
- Method-level test coverage
- API endpoint to test mapping
- Database schema change impact
- Configuration change impact

**API Example:**
```csharp
var impactAnalyzer = new CrossLayerImpactAnalyzer(solutionPath);

// AI agent asks: "What tests should I run if I change UserService.GetUser()?"
var affectedTests = await impactAnalyzer.GetAffectedTestsAsync(
    changedFiles: ["Services/UserService.cs"],
    changedMethods: ["GetUser"]
);
```

### 4. Intelligent Test Selection Engine

**Functionality:**
- Combine insights from all analyzers
- Recommend optimal test execution strategy
- Support for different confidence levels
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

**Selection Strategies:**
- **Fast Feedback** - Run only directly affected unit tests (~30 seconds)
- **Medium Confidence** - Add integration tests for changed components (~5 minutes)  
- **High Confidence** - Include cross-system tests (~15 minutes)
- **Full Validation** - Complete test suite for releases

## Technical Architecture

### Multi-Framework Support

**Challenge:** The solution must support both .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET 8+ codebases within the same monorepo.

**Architecture Decision:** Build as .NET Standard 2.0 library with framework-specific adapters where needed.

### Core Components

**TestCategorizer**
- Cross-framework NUnit assembly reflection (.NET Framework & .NET Core)
- Framework-aware execution time monitoring
- Dependency detection via static analysis (Roslyn for both frameworks)

**TestDataTracker**  
- Entity Framework 6.x (.NET Framework) and EF Core analysis
- Database seeding pattern recognition across frameworks
- Mock framework integration detection (Moq, NSubstitute compatibility)

**ImpactAnalyzer**
- Unified Roslyn-based static analysis for both frameworks
- Framework-aware call graph generation
- Cross-framework test execution tracing

**SelectionEngine**
- Multi-factor test scoring
- Framework-aware execution time optimization
- Risk-based test prioritization

### Framework-Specific Considerations

**Assembly Loading:**
```csharp
// Handle both .NET Framework and .NET Core assemblies
public class CrossFrameworkAssemblyLoader
{
    public Assembly LoadTestAssembly(string assemblyPath)
    {
        if (IsNetFrameworkAssembly(assemblyPath))
            return LoadFrameworkAssembly(assemblyPath);
        else
            return LoadCoreAssembly(assemblyPath);
    }
}
```

**Entity Framework Detection:**
- EF6 patterns for .NET Framework projects
- EF Core patterns for .NET 8+ projects
- Mixed scenarios where both might exist

### Integration Points

**Build Pipeline Integration:**
```xml
<!-- For .NET Framework 4.8 projects -->
<Target Name="GenerateTestIntelligence" BeforeTargets="Test">
  <Exec Command="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)tools\TestIntelligence.exe analyze --solution $(SolutionPath) --framework net48 --output $(OutputPath)" />
</Target>

<!-- For .NET 8+ projects -->
<Target Name="GenerateTestIntelligence" BeforeTargets="Test">
  <Exec Command="dotnet test-intelligence analyze --solution $(SolutionPath) --framework net8.0 --output $(OutputPath)" />
</Target>
```

**Cross-Framework AI Agent Integration:**
```csharp
// AI agent workflow - framework agnostic
var testIntelligence = new TestIntelligenceEngine(solutionPath);

// Automatically detects mixed .NET Framework/.NET Core projects
var recommendations = await testIntelligence.GetTestRecommendationsAsync(codeChanges);

// Separate execution for different frameworks
var net48Tests = recommendations.TestBatches.Where(t => t.TargetFramework == "net48");
var net8Tests = recommendations.TestBatches.Where(t => t.TargetFramework == "net8.0");

// Run framework-specific test batches
var net48Results = await RunDotNetFrameworkTestsAsync(net48Tests);
var net8Results = await RunDotNetCoreTestsAsync(net8Tests);
```

## Success Metrics

## Open Questions

1. Should we integrate with existing test result databases or create our own?
2. How should we handle tests that use external dependencies (APIs, services)?
3. What level of integration with your custom database upgrade system is needed?
4. Should we provide a UI for visualizing test relationships, or focus purely on API/CLI?

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine requirements based on your specific test patterns
2. Prototype the test categorizer with a subset of your actual test suite
3. Define integration points with your existing build pipeline
4. Create proof-of-concept with AI agent integration
